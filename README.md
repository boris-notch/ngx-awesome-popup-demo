This is a demo page built in Angular that utilizes the Ngx Awesome Popup library, showcasing various use cases.
Additionally, a practical example with CRUD operations on a local JSON server running on port 3000 is implemented, along
with state management. Feel free to clone the repository and use the code examples without any restrictions.

To start the application, use the command `npm start`, which will run the Angular application in the background on port
4200 and the JSON server on port 3000.
